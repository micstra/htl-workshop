# workshop-ui


## How did we get here?
To create a similar setup follow these steps:

### General Setup
+ make sure you have npm installed on your machine
+ run `npm init vue@latest` 

### PrimeFaces
We are using PrimeFaces as an component library since we do not want to write our own UI components for this example
To install it follow the instructions at https://www.primefaces.org/primevue/setup

```
npm install primevue@^3.13.1 --save
npm install primeicons --save
```

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
